# Population-Dynamics-Modeling

## Problem
This Python script models the interaction between rabbit and cat populations sharing the same ecosystem. The simulation considers factors such as rabbit population growth, predation by cats, the impact of cars on both populations, and initial population sizes.

## Simulation Details

1. **Rabbit Population Growth Rate:** The rabbit population multiplies at a constant rate of 0.1.
2. **Interaction (Cat Population Growth Rate):** Cats feed on rabbits, resulting in a rate of 0.1 Ã— 0.0005 per rabbit and cat.
3. **Cars:** Both populations face a 0.05 chance of being run over by cars.
4. **Initial Population Size:**
   - Rabbit Population (R0): 400
   - Cat Population (C0): 50

## Solution
After plotting their population's growth, as we expect, both plots show us that the increase\decrease growth of rabbits' population has the direct effect on the growth of cats' population, because the rabbits are food of cats.
